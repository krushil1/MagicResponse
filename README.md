# MagicResponse 

Create your version of an 8-ball program called MagicResponse.  It must be different – be creative.  It can  give financial advice, tell your future, predict the weather based on the day of the week, etc.  

Come up with at least 8 different responses. The  program should choose a random number from 1 to # responses and then use if statements to test the number and print out the associated random response.  ONLY USE IF STATEMENTS!  Add appropriate comments and other features of good coding style.

example Output: 

Hi!  Let’s Play Magic 8-Ball!
